Algorithms Course 2
=================

This project contains implementation of different algorithms and data structures I studied during Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2 course by Tim Roughgarden on Coursera.

Algorithms implemented: Prim's MST, Kruskal's MST.

Problems solved: jobs scheduling, single-link clustering, Knapsack problem, All Pairs Shortest Path, Traveling Salesman problem.

Data structures implemented: UnionFind, Heap (Priority Queue), MultiValue Dictionary (MultiValue HashMap).

Language: C#

For Coursera students: Remember that your knowledge is more important than your Coursera grades. Implementing all these algorithms is really a lot of fun.
